# Hello

@javosanc here,

Been coding for more than 15 years. Never been interested in becoming a "developer"... until now...

There's so much to do with J.U.S.T code right now (I was more of a hardware guy in the past.)

Anyway, some of my interests:
- Creative coding
- Show control and networking
- Shaders
- Data analysis
- Blockchain
- AR/VR development

If you want to chat just shoot a message!
